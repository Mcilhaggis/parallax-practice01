        <h2>"Do yourself a favour and don't go looking at the pictures on my phone.."</h2>
        <p>A lot of life can happen over the course of one record. Lyrics immortalize those characters, exploits, and memories. On his 2020 Asterisk The Universe, John Craigie awkwardly encounters previous flames, mistakes a Catholic School custodian as a saint (and prays to him anyway), pays tribute to modern-day revolutionaries, and explores what it all means to live in the 21st century where infinite possibility does not necessarily equate infinite understanding. He soundtracks these stories with a score of smoked-out soul, tender folk, and American songbook eloquence billowing right from the heart of California. Progressing once more, the interplay of live drums and bass hold the music in the pocket as it simultaneously emanates an acoustic campfire glow.</p>

            <h2>Coldest Colorado</h2>
            <p>I give my two weeks in two weeks, guess it’s way past its time
            I never crossed that white river, never felt the other side
            
            Or the coldest Colorado, or the hottest Louisi Ann
            Or the driest Mojave, I will write you when I can
            Every songbird sings its tune, as it chases the waning moon
            And I can’t follow something that does not move
            
            I’ve been walking these same streets, I’ve been under this old spell
            And in all honesty, I fear purgatory more than I fear hell
            
            Or the coldest Colorado, or the hottest Louisi Ann
            Or the driest Mojave, I will write you when I can
            Every songbird sings its tune, as it chases the waning moon
            And I can’t follow something that does not move</p>
